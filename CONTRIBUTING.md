>The mouth should have three gatekeepers. Is it true? Is it kind? And is it necessary?

― Arab proverb

A good friend told me about this proverb, I like it a lot.

When you feel angry, annoyed, or impatient, give yourself rest from what you are doing and treat yourself to something nice. Your favorite song, a hot bath, a delicious meal, or watching a funny compilation of dogs that feel overtly guilty for chewing up some paper but actually that makes them even more lovable ☺️.
