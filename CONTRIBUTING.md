>The mouth should have three gatekeepers. Is it true? Is it kind? And is it necessary?

‚Äï Arab proverb

A good friend told me about this proverb, I like it a lot.

When contributing to this project try to speak from the heart with good intentions, have compassion and empathy. This is not always possible and that's ok, we can only try.

When you feel angry, annoyed, or impatient, give yourself rest from what you are doing and treat yourself to something nice. Your favorite song for your mood, a hot bath, a delicious meal, or watching a funny compilation of dogs that feel overtly guilty for chewing up an old magazine but actually that makes them even more lovable ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

Thank you for your help, do only as much as you can, and may you also receive help in your life for the things that matter to you üåû.
